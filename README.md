OppoThailandADBDriver.patched
=============================

This is the Oppo Find 5's Windows 32 and 64-bit driver, patched with the latest H/W IDs for the Oppo Find 5.
This should work on the later model.
The USB VID has been changed to reflect that.

License:

I couldn't care less.
Uploaded  this just to patch an outdated ADB driver for Windows. 

Questions?

Ask Oppo. Why they would leave out a generation of devices out of an ADB driver is beyond me.

Tested on:

Windows XP (32-BIT only)
Windows 7 (32-bit and 64-bit)
Windows 8 (32-bit and 64-bit).

It works for me with the following setup:

Oppo Find 5 (rooted)
TWRP recovery.
OmniROM nightly build.

Happy hacking!
